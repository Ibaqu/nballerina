# Implementation plan

The plan is to implement progressively larger subsets of the language, where each subset is precisely specified  and [correctly](correctness.md) implemented. We may decide to temporarily deviate from correctness in some respects: any such conscious deviations will be explicitly noted in the subset specification.

We are in process of implementing [subset 1](subset01.md).

No subset has been completed so far.
